Ying is a visiting 4th year PhD student from the Research Center for Eco-environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. She is visiting the Drylands Research Group for 6 months funded by a Chinese Council Scholarship (CSC).

For her PhD she is exploring the impact of climate change on ecosystems, including ecosystem functions (ecosystem resilience, ecosystem water use efficiency, etc.) and ecosystem processes (phenology).

During her stay in Bristol, she is working on analysing the impact of climate on vegetation dynamics in drylands.
