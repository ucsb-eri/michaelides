George is a PhD student in the [School of Geographical Sciences](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/) at [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/). With a background in both hydrology and meteorology, he is interested in better understanding surface-subsurface water dynamics and wider hydroclimatological feedbacks.

Within DOWN2EARTH, George is working on assessing the rainstorm-scale impacts of climate change on the water balance in East African drylands, using a variety of high-resolution sub-daily datasets. As part of his project, he is also working with the UK Met Office to explore the rainfall and PET characteristics of convection-permitting climate models, and how this impacts hydrology.

Prior to beginning his PhD, George completed a BSc in Environmental Geography (Cardiff University) and an MSc in Climate Change (UCL).
